Restfully Authenticated Generator
====

This is a advanced restful authentication generator for rails, taken 
from acts as authenticated.  Currently it requires Rails 2.0.2 or above.

To use:

  ./script/generate authenticated user sessions

The first parameter specifies the model that gets created in signup
(typically a user or account model).  A model with migration is 
created, as well as a basic controller with the create method.

The second parameter specifies the sessions controller name.  This is
the controller that handles the actual login/logout function on the 
site.

This generator includes an ActionMailer and its respective Activation Code through email.

This generator also builds in support for acts_as_state_machine
and generates activation code.  This was taken from:

http://www.vaporbase.com/postings/stateful_authentication

You can pass --skip-migration to skip the user migration.

Define your users resource like this:

	map.resources :users, :member => { :suspend   => :put,
                                     :unsuspend => :put,
                                     :purge     => :delete }
